# Navigating around the downstream kernel (BCM21654/BCM28155 Samsung 3.0 release)]

You're on your own.

Unfortunately, in terms of device files, the 3.0 kernel release is very different from the 3.4 kernel and the mach-capri/rhea directories are **filled with header files** instead of board files.

Not much further research has been done on these kernels yet, but it's assumed that the driver side of things may be fairly similar to the 3.4 releases. **If you own one of these devices, please investigate this** and report your findings back to this repo (either via an issue or a pull request).
