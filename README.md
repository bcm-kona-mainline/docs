# Broadcom Kona mainlining docs

This page serves as the general documentation for the Samsung + Broadcom Kona mainlining project, as well as downstream documentation and installation guides.

Most of this information also applies to non-Samsung devices using these chipsets; it's just that the Samsung devices happen to share a lot of common components, and have easily available downstream kernels.

There's a WIP list of Samsung devices with Broadcom Kona chipsets available [under this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NioX9a2vgbEcO_Zs9COUFO-n3a2Rqf1JWWU1cfsktLM/edit?usp=sharing) - if you'd like to add your device, or info about your device to the list, contact [knuxify](https://tilde.town/~knuxify).
